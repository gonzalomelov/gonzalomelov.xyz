## Summary

I'm an engineer with 10+ years in development and product, specializing in startups and blockchain.

Recently, I worked on blockchain solutions at [Web3Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3pro) and [The Sandbox Game](https://www.sandbox.game/en/shop), focusing on NFT marketplaces. Participating solo, I received the overall Top Prize in the [Decentralized Intelligence S2](https://learnweb3.io/hackathons/decentralized-intelligence-season-2/projects/749ff9f5-a05e-4c12-b71b-8eee23c61c9f) hackathon and ranked in the Top 20 out of more than 1200 projects in the [Onchain Summer QV](https://onchain-summer.devfolio.co/leaderboard).

Previously, I co-owned [KONA (acq. by Technisys)](https://ibsintelligence.com/ibsi-news/technisys-acquires-conversational-ai-innovator-kona-to-elevate-digital-banking-experience), where I helped grow an AI startup focused on conversational agents for the banking industry from zero to exit.

I have a solid foundation in TypeScript and Node.js, with experience across the full stack, including React, Next.js, Solidity, Ethers.js, SQL, NoSQL, Python, UX/UI, Cloud, and DevOps.
